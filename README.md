# Help the World
This is a simple game to help you keep track of your progress when trying to improve your impact on climate change. It contains a possible activity list, and a shop. It will autosave every 10 seconds.

## Download
The app runs on [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). You can download and run a version you can edit with the following commands on MacOS:

```shell script
# Download repository
git clone https://github.com/codeNinja-1/help-the-world
# Select repository directory
cd help-the-world
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Initialize as a package
npm init
# Start the application
npm start
```

This application only works on MacOS for the moment, but we are working on adding support for more operating systems.
